## **CubeSat ADCS OBC Challenge** üõ∞Ô∏è

### **Overview**
This repository contains the software for an Attitude Determination and Control System (**ADCS**) for a CubeSat. The software is integrated with **cFS** (Core Flight System) and includes a telemetry bridge for data visualization. This project focuses on demonstrating robust fault handling and system stability.

***

### **Structure**
* `src/`: Contains the source files for the ADCS system and microcontroller emulation.
* `inc/`: Contains the corresponding header files.
* `adcs_test_harness.cpp`: A test harness for simulating the ADCS behavior and injecting controlled faults.
* `DOC.md`: Detailed documentation of the software's approach, integration, and testing methodology.
* `telemetry_bridge.py`: A Python script to process and handle telemetry output from the simulation.

***

### **Build & Run**
To build and run the simulation, navigate to the `fsw` directory and execute the following commands. The build command compiles the C++ source files into a single executable, `adcs_test_harness`.

```bash
cd fsw
g++ -std=c++17 -I./inc -I./src \
    src/adcs_controller.cpp \
    src/microcontroller.cpp \
    src/microcontroller_wrapper_c.cpp \
    src/pid_controller.cpp \
    adcs_test_harness.cpp \
    -o adcs_test_harness

./adcs_test_harness | python3 ../telemetry_bridge.py

### Docker Build & Run

1. Build the Docker image:
```bash
docker build -t adcs_cfs_sim:latest .

docker run -it adcs_cfs_sim:latest

cd fsw
./adcs_test_harness | python3 /workspace/telemetry_bridge.py

Save and exit. This ensures anyone can replicate your environment and run the simulation.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Enhance Fault Injection Documentation in DOC.md**

Open your `DOC.md`:

```bash
vim DOC.md

#### Fault Injection Mechanism

- A controlled fault is introduced in the gyroscope sensor readings at cycle 10.
- The fault sets `gyro[0] = 0` (or another predefined invalid value).
- The Microcontroller class detects this fault in `performFaultDetection()`.
- After 3 consecutive fault detections, the system automatically switches to safe mode.
- The telemetry bridge prints `Status: FAULT` once the threshold is breached.
